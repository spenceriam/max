# Max

AI orchestrator powered by [Copilot SDK](https://github.com/github/copilot-sdk) — control multiple Copilot CLI sessions from Telegram or a local terminal.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/burkeholland/max/main/install.sh | bash
```

Or install directly with npm:

```bash
npm install -g heymax
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Run setup

```bash
max setup
```

This creates `~/.max/` and walks you through configuration (Telegram bot token, etc.). Telegram is optional — you can use Max with just the terminal UI.
At the end of setup, Max can also register itself to start automatically when you log in.

### 2. Make sure Copilot CLI is authenticated

```bash
copilot login
```

### 3. Start Max

```bash
max start
```

### 4. Connect via terminal

In a separate terminal:

```bash
max tui
```

### 5. Talk to Max

From Telegram or the TUI, just send natural language:

- "Start working on the auth bug in ~/dev/myapp"
- "What sessions are running?"
- "Check on the api-tests session"
- "Kill the auth-fix session"
- "What's the capital of France?"

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `max start` | Start the Max daemon |
| `max tui` | Connect to the daemon via terminal |
| `max setup` | Interactive first-run configuration |
| `max config` | Show or change saved configuration |
| `max autostart` | Enable, disable, or inspect automatic startup |
| `max doctor` | Run installation and runtime diagnostics |
| `max update` | Check for and install updates |
| `max help` | Show available commands |

## VPS / Command Center

Max still binds its API to `127.0.0.1` by default. For VPS use, keep that default and access Max through:

```bash
ssh -L 7777:127.0.0.1:7777 your-vps
```

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:7777/dashboard
```

Use the token from:

```bash
max config show-token
```

If you want browser access without SSH tunneling, put an HTTPS reverse proxy in front of Max and keep the daemon itself bound to localhost.

If you validate the dashboard with Vercel's `agent-browser` on a Linux VPS or container, Chromium may require:

```bash
agent-browser --args "--no-sandbox" open http://127.0.0.1:7777/dashboard
```

### Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--self-edit` | Allow Max to modify his own source code (use with `max start`) |

### TUI commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/model [name]` | Show or switch the current model |
| `/memory` | Show stored memories |
| `/skills` | List installed skills |
| `/workers` | List active worker sessions |
| `/copy` | Copy last response to clipboard |
| `/status` | Daemon health check |
| `/restart` | Restart the daemon |
| `/cancel` | Cancel the current in-flight message |
| `/clear` | Clear the screen |
| `/help` | Show help |
| `/quit` | Exit the TUI |
| `Escape` | Cancel a running response |

## How it Works

Max runs a persistent **orchestrator Copilot session** — an always-on AI brain that receives your messages and decides how to handle them. For coding tasks, it spawns **worker Copilot sessions** in specific directories. For simple questions, it answers directly.

You can talk to Max from:
- **Telegram** — remote access from your phone (authenticated by user ID)
- **TUI** — local terminal client (no auth needed)

## Architecture

```
Telegram ──→ Max Daemon ←── TUI
                │
          Orchestrator Session (Copilot SDK)
                │
      ┌─────────┼─────────┐
   Worker 1  Worker 2  Worker N
```

- **Daemon** (`max start`) — persistent service running Copilot SDK + Telegram bot + HTTP API
- **TUI** (`max tui`) — lightweight terminal client connecting to the daemon
- **Orchestrator** — long-running Copilot session with custom tools for session management
- **Workers** — child Copilot sessions for specific coding tasks

## Development
